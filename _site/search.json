In other words Reproducibility means that someone else ‚Äîor even you in six months‚Äî can take your data and your code, run it again, and get the same results. In research, this ensures transparency, trust, and the ability to build upon previous work. It‚Äôs like leaving breadcrumbs through the forest of your analysis so no one gets lost."

    "text": "Reproducible is distinct from replicable, robust and generalisable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow the Turing Way defines reproducible research\n\n\n\nThe different dimensions of reproducible research described in the matrix above have the following definitions:\n\nReproducible: A result is reproducible when the same analysis steps performed on the same dataset consistently produces the same answer.\nReplicable: A result is replicable when the same analysis performed on different datasets produces qualitatively similar answers.\nRobust: A result is robust when the same dataset is subjected to different analysis workflows to answer the same research question (for example one pipeline written in R and another written in Python) and a qualitatively similar or identical answer is produced. Robust results show that the work is not dependent on the specificities of the programming language chosen to perform the analysis.\nGeneralisable: Combining replicable and robust findings allow us to form generalisable results. Note that running an analysis on a different software implementation and with a different dataset does not provide generalised results. There will be many more steps to know how well the work applies to all the different aspects of the research question. Generalisation is an important step towards understanding that the result is not dependent on a particular dataset nor a particular version of the analysis pipeline.\n\nReproducible code is code that runs consistently and automatically produces the same outputs ‚Äî tables, plots, models ‚Äî from the same data. Instead of copying-and-pasting results into Word or PowerPoint, you write scripts that generate the full report. This minimizes errors, saves time, and lets your research live and breathe alongside your data."
