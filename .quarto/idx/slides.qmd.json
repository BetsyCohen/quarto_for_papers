authored in your favorite code editor\n\n-   apply journal styles to your outputs with Quarto extensions\n\n-   orchestrate multiple inputs and outputs with embedded computing using a new Quarto project type: manuscript\n\n-   produce manuscripts in multiple formats (including LaTeX or MS Word formats required by journals), and give readers easy access to all of the formats through a website\n\n-   publish computations from one or more notebooks alongside the manuscript, allowing readers to dive into your code and view it or interact with it in a virtual environment\n\n-   publish to GitHub Pages, Netlify, and more\n\n## Let's get started with a manuscript\n\n### Option 1: Start from scratch\n\n-   Create a Quarto manuscript:\n\n    -   RStudio: New Project \\> New Directory \\> Quarto Manuscript or\n\n    -   `quarto create project manuscript <name>`\n\n-   Add manuscript content\n\n### Option 2:  Start with a sample from \n\n<https://quarto.org/docs/manuscripts>\n\n::: callout-tip\nLearn how to Track your project with Git and host on GitHub for happy publishing.\n:::\n\n## How does it look like?\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe src=\"https://dragonstyle.github.io/submission-quarto-lite-r/\" title=\"La Palma Earthquakes\" width=\"1100px\" height=\"600px\"></iframe>\n```\n\n\n## Your turn!\n\nCreate a Quarto manuscript \n\n## Setting \n\n\nWhat's next?\nActually dive into the code We've seen that you can peruse the code underlying the figures and tables in the manuscript\n\nWhat if you wanted to interact with the code -- in a computational environment that's just a click away and that has all the software and packages needed to reproduce the manuscript?\n\n![](img/console-clone-repo.png)\n\n::: notes\nAs I asume you do noit have experience working with git hub we're gone practice a semi reproductrivble version of how tob worlk with repoductible manuscripts.\nIf you are familiarizedf eith github you'll finde the cmplete worknlow in the Quarto documentation iun the Manusucript section.\n:::\n"},"formats":{"revealjs":{"identifier":{"display-name":"RevealJS","target-format":"revealjs","base-format":"revealjs"},"execute":{"fig-width":10,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":false,"output":true,"warning":false,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":true,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","html-math-method":{"method":"mathjax","url":"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.9/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS_HTML-full"},"slide-level":2,"to":"revealjs","incremental":true,"output-file":"slides.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
