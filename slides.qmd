# Why Reproducibility?

## What do we mean by reproductibility

::: notes
There are several definitions of reproducibility in use but in the context of this meeting we will refer to reproductibilty in as *Computational reproducibility: When detailed information is provided about code, software, hardware and implementation details.* In other words Reproducibility means that someone else ---or even you in six months--- can take your data and your code, run it again, and get the same results.
In research, this ensures transparency, trust, and the ability to build upon previous work.
It's like leaving breadcrumbs through the forest of your analysis so no one gets lost.

## Reproducible is distinct from replicable, robust and generalisable

[![How the Turing Way defines reproducible research](img/reproducible-matrix.jpg){fig-alt="How the Turing Way defines reproducible research" fig-align="center"}](https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/overview/overview-definitions)

::: notes
The different dimensions of reproducible research described in the matrix above have the following definitions:

-   **Reproducible:** A result is reproducible when the *same* analysis steps performed on the *same* dataset consistently produces the *same* answer.

-   **Replicable:** A result is replicable when the *same* analysis performed on *different* datasets produces qualitatively similar answers.

-   **Robust:** A result is robust when the *same* dataset is subjected to *different* analysis workflows to answer the same research question (for example one pipeline written in R and another written in Python) and a qualitatively similar or identical answer is produced.
    Robust results show that the work is not dependent on the specificities of the programming language chosen to perform the analysis.

-   **Generalisable:** Combining replicable and robust findings allow us to form generalisable results.
    Note that running an analysis on a different software implementation and with a different dataset does not provide *generalised* results.
    There will be many more steps to know how well the work applies to all the different aspects of the research question.
    Generalisation is an important step towards understanding that the result is not dependent on a particular dataset nor a particular version of the analysis pipeline.

Reproducible code is code that runs consistently and automatically produces the same outputs --- tables, plots, models --- from the same data.
Instead of copying-and-pasting results into Word or PowerPoint, you write scripts that generate the full report.
This minimizes errors, saves time, and lets your research live and breathe alongside your data.

::: notes
Open research aims to transform research by making it more reproducible, transparent, reusable, collaborative, accountable, and accessible to society.

The Turing Way (open collaboration, and community-driven project that has produce a handbook to reproducible, ethical and collaborative data science.) suggest a checklist for Open

**Open Data**

-   Ensure your data is in a simple, standard format or formats which is machine and human-readable.

-   Check, reformat or create metadata to clearly describe what the data is, how it was collected, and any associated strengths/weaknesses to someone that finds it.

-   Identify a relevant, easily discoverable repository or repositories to host your data, and upload it there.

-   Assign your data a persistent identifier such as a DOI.

**Open Source Software**

-   Put your code in a freely accessible repository.

-   Include a licence granting others the right to use, copy and modify your work.
    You can use the [**Licensing**](https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/licensing) chapter to help you pick the most appropriate licence for your project.

-   Include a README file containing useful information about a project such as what it is, how to use/install it and how to run any tests.

-   If you want others to collaborate on the project include contribution guidelines.

**Open Hardware**

-   Use open hardware where practical.

-   Make detailed documentation and designs for any hardware you develop openly available.

-   Include a licence granting others the right to use, copy and modify your work.
    You can use [**this**](https://choosealicense.com/) website to help you pick the most appropriate licence for your project.

-   Include a README file containing useful information about a project (for example, what it is and the materials used).

**Open Access**

-   Publish your research in an open-access journal.

-   Store a copy or preprint of your work in a freely accessible public repository.

**Open Notebooks**

-   Keep notes in an **Electronic Lab Notebook**.

-   Make your notebooks **publicly accessible online**.

# What is Quarto?

## Analyze. Share. Reproduce

-   An open-source scientific and technical publishing system

-   Create dynamic content with Python, R, Julia, and Observable.

-   Publish reproducible, production quality articles, presentations, dashboards, websites, blogs, and books in HTML, PDF, MS Word, ePub, and more.

-   Share knowledge and insights organization-wide by publishing to Posit Connect, Confluence, or other publishing systems.

-   Write using Pandoc markdown, including equations, citations, crossrefs, figure panels, callouts, advanced layout, and more.

::: notes
A multi-language, next generation version of R Markdown from Posit, with many new features and capabilities.

Like R Markdown, Quarto uses knitr to execute R code, and is therefore able to render most existing Rmd files without modification.

# A short walk around

## Install Quarto

![](img/install_quarto.gif){fig-align="center"}

## Create a Quarto File in a project we already have

![](img/create_qmd_file.png){fig-align="center"}

## Create a New Quarto Project

![](img/new_project_wizard_quarto.png){fig-align="left"}

## Folder structure in a Quarto Project

![](img/quarto_project_schema.png)

::: notes
When we create a Quarto project we'll automatically create RPorj file (as in any other Quarto project) and a .yml file (for the entire project), my Quarto document (the one that has the .qmd extension.
:::

## Quarto file general structure

![](img/quart-html-file-1.png)

::: notes
For those of you have worked with RMarkdown before this should be familiar, at the top we have a YAML with some metadata about our file, like the title, format (we'll start by an html)
:::

## Visual mode vs Source mode

![](https://quarto.org/docs/visual-editor/images/visual-editing-switch-modes.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
The Quarto visual editor is currently available as a feature of the [RStudio IDE](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). The visual editor will eventually also be made available in standalone form.
You can switch over the source editor, and things should look pretty familiar to you.

The visual editor where you get a documeny that feels similar to a Google Doc in an app-like notion wehere yjos are a liitle bit more you see-what-you-get.

For example I hace some infromation about the data set and I may want to bold the name if the package.

I can add a link to a website.

# Quarto for journal articles

## Quarto can

-   be authored in your favorite code editor

-   apply journal styles to your outputs with Quarto extensions

-   orchestrate multiple inputs and outputs with embedded computing using a new Quarto project type: manuscript

-   produce manuscripts in multiple formats (including LaTeX or MS Word formats required by journals), and give readers easy access to all of the formats through a website

-   publish computations from one or more notebooks alongside the manuscript, allowing readers to dive into your code and view it or interact with it in a virtual environment

-   publish to GitHub Pages, Netlify, and more

## Let's get started with a manuscript

### Option 1: Start from scratch

-   Create a Quarto manuscript:

    -   RStudio: New Project \> New Directory \> Quarto Manuscript or

    -   `quarto create project manuscript <name>`

-   Add manuscript content

### Option 2:  Start with a sample from 

<https://quarto.org/docs/manuscripts>

::: callout-tip
Learn how to Track your project with Git and host on GitHub for happy publishing.

## How does it look like?

```


## Your turn!

Create a Quarto manuscript 

## Setting 


What's next?
Actually dive into the code We've seen that you can peruse the code underlying the figures and tables in the manuscript

What if you wanted to interact with the code -- in a computational environment that's just a click away and that has all the software and packages needed to reproduce the manuscript?

::: notes
As I asume you do noit have experience working with git hub we're gone practice a semi reproductrivble version of how tob worlk with repoductible manuscripts.
If you are familiarizedf eith github you'll finde the cmplete worknlow in the Quarto documentation iun the Manusucript section.
